# Explanations:
#  prefix: Prefix entered before a message to send to channel (or reverse, see below)
#  prefix-sends-to-channel: true/false. If true, a message will be sent to the channel if
#                                       message starts with the prefix. If false, message
#                                       will be sent globally if message starts with prefix
#                                       and the player is in a channel.
#  message-format: Format for the channel messages.
#  links-require-permission: If true, will try to detect URLs in message and block if they
#                           don't have the quickchannels.links permission.
#  console-output: true/false. Whether to send channel messages into console for logging.
#  remove-on-quit: true/false. Whether to remove player from channel when they leave.
# -----------------------------
# Available placeholders:
